# 🔐 Advanced Password Generator (GUI) – Oasis Infobyte Python Internship

This is an advanced-level password generator built using **Python** and **Tkinter** for the Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship Program (Python Programming Domain).

It allows users to customize password length, select character types (letters, digits, symbols), exclude ambiguous characters, and even copies the password directly to the clipboard. It also logs all generated passwords to a file with timestamps and gives a live strength rating.
